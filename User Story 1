The user of my website should be able to type in keywords or phrases and get a GIF returned to them that is related to what was entered in the search field. In the about section, I give an example of a GIF I looked up and how it made my day a little bit better. I currently work in a call center doing support so I understand the frustration. Either having to call in and get someone that doesnâ€™t know what they are talking about/ doing when you call, or having a customer call and ask me questions that dont make any sense. So I then have to ask the customer questions to get to the point of the call and assist the customer.
