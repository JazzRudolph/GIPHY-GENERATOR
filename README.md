# GIPHY-GENERATOR
Jazz Rudolph

This project was alot of fun and hard work puting everything I've learned so far into work,
I am extremly proud of myself. The project is a gif generator powered by Giphy's API, 
so when you type a keyword or phrase into the search field you get one result. 
It was important to me to figure when you did a new search to clear the previous gif 
and display the new gif for the new search. I did not want them to stack ontop of 
eachother and I did not want the user to have to scroll the page to find the gif. 
I also made the links in the nav bar clickable so it will take you to the desired 
section of the webpage. 

I used HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Giphy, API, VS code, and Github.

Three improvements for this project:
Have my gallery display Giphy trending stickers or photos.
Add more color and appealing instead of purple on purple it is kind of basic but its clean code.
Learn how to properly indent my code from the begining so I wont have to fix it a bunch of 
times while coding.
